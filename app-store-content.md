## App Description

ðŸ’© **Finally, an app that pays you back!**

Tired of working for "the man"? It's time to flip the script. Paid to Operate helps you calculate exactly how much you're earning during those essential bathroom breaks. Because if you're good at something, never do it for free!

**The Modern Worker's Secret Weapon:**
â€¢ **Timer That Pays**: Track every minute and watch your "sitting earnings" add up
â€¢ **Revenge Analytics**: See how much you've "cost" your employer this week
â€¢ **Stealth Mode**: Professional interface that looks like a productivity app
â€¢ **Poop Diary**: Log your victories with mood tracking and notes
â€¢ **Boss-Proof**: All data stays on your device (what they don't know won't hurt them)

**Perfect for:**
- Employees who've had enough
- Anyone who's ever felt underpaid
- People who understand that "time is money" works both ways
- Those who believe in work-life balance (heavy emphasis on life)

Remember: They pay you salary, not by the hour you're NOT in the bathroom. Time to collect what's rightfully yours!

**Legal Note:** This app calculates theoretical earnings based on your hourly rate. We're not actually stealing from your company... or are we? ðŸ˜‰

Boss makes a dollar, you make a dime - that's why you poop on company time! ðŸš½ðŸ’°
