## 🚀 About the App

**Paid To Operate (PTO)** is a tongue-in-cheek productivity app built with SwiftUI for iOS.  
It helps you calculate how much money you’re earning every time you… step away from your desk.  

All you need to do:
1. Enter your hourly wage.
2. Start the timer when you go.
3. Stop the timer when you’re done.
4. See your **💵 earnings** instantly.

Because sometimes, the best part of the workday isn’t in the job description. 😉
