## 🚀 About the App

**Paid To Operate (PTO)** is the ultimate workplace rebellion tool disguised as a productivity app. Built with SwiftUI for iOS, it calculates exactly how much you're earning during those essential bathroom breaks.

### The Modern Worker's Secret Weapon:
- **Timer That Pays**: Track every minute and watch your "sitting earnings" add up
- **Revenge Analytics**: See how much you've "cost" your employer this week  
- **Stealth Mode**: Professional interface that looks like a productivity app
- **Poop Diary**: Log your victories with mood tracking and notes
- **Boss-Proof**: All data stays on your device (what they don't know won't hurt them)

**Perfect for:**
- Employees who've had enough
- Anyone who's ever felt underpaid  
- People who understand that "time is money" works both ways
- Those who believe in work-life balance (heavy emphasis on life)
